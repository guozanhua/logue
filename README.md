Logue is an open source application for augmenting social interactions by providing behavioural feedback in realtime using different modalities: visual, auditory and haptic. The aim is to increase awareness and improve the quality of one's own nonverbal behaviour.
  
The behaviour of the user is extracted from various sensors and then analysed in realtime using the SSJ framework.
The application is being developed at the Human Centered Multimedia Lab of the Augsburg University under the lead of Ionut Damian.
